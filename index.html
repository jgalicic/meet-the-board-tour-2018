	 				<p> The small home garden of Richard Hartlage acts as the laboratory for his design firm, Land Morphology. With a six foot, hand-made Italian pot sculpture in front, you can’t miss the house from the street (perhaps the vermillion paint job gives it away too!). The front garden meadow features a serpentine of boxwood which frames the plantings and provides winter structure. Venturing into the backyard, the first seating area is a deck clad in diamond plate aluminum and ringed in terracotta planters of boxwood topiaries. The lower area is paved in granite planks with a turquoise ceramic table as a focal point. This area is enclosed with industrial containers planted with rare shade plants and a gnat haze of hanging baskets swarming overhead. A nine-foot-long water trough is planted with waterlilies and aquatic iris. Privacy is provided by a weathered steel fence. The dramatic features of this garden are intended to be enjoyed by small gatherings.</p>

	 				<p>Gillian Mathews, NHS board member and owner of Ravenna Gardens, has created a functional and stylish garden in her new Seattle home. Two years ago Richard Hartlage (see above) designed the bones of the garden. Flawlessly forged hardscaping takes center stage in the back with gabion walls, an elegant outdoor dining area, and rusted steel containers defining the space. An old Yorkshire sheep trough has been repurposed into a babbling fountain. Fruits, vegetables and herbs flourish in the sunny back garden while clipped boxwoods, lavender and other evergreens create a quieter living space in the front. This formerly grass-dominated lot showcases that going from ordinary to extraordinary can happen in just one year.</p>

	 				<p>Three years ago, University of Washington Botanic Gardens Director Emeritus Dr. John Wott breathed new life into his mature garden by reverting back to an almost blank slate. While the original garden contained many early Dan Hinkley introductions from Heronswood Nursery, his new garden features plants specifically selected by Dan Hinkley to add texture and lower maintenance. Architect and Heronswood co-founder Robert Jones designed the deck and trellis. Moveable seasonal pots along with many succulents provide drama and color throughout the year. The upper deck features a panoramic westward view over the city and UW. Don’t miss a chance to visit this lush garden!</p>

	 				<p>A confluence of geometry and texture echo throughout Lisa Bauer’s urban garden. Owner of Chartreuse Landscape Design and winner of the 2015 Northwest Flower & Garden Show Founder’s Cup, Lisa effortlessly showcases an array of juxtaposing ideas: shapes in opposition, hardscape vs. softscape and vertical vs. horizontal. Garden elements fit together like a puzzle surrounding the house. Steel arcs, ovals, squares, an arcing stone path, concrete, wood and water define the garden. A Robert Sperry mural is centered over a long water feature filled with fish and carnivorous plants. Bold geometry and structure becomes the logical solution for this tight urban space. The back garden is a place for fantasy and where big foliage, modern art, and an eclectic plant mix will transport you away to another world.</p>

	 				<p>The vibrant plantings in this garden reveal a true oasis of desire. Lush, flowery abundance overflows the parking strips and extends to all corners of the extensive corner lot. Hummingbirds flutter to sample the salvias, Cape fuchsias, and bee balm. Even the driveway is covered with pots of cactus and exotics. Time management is of the utmost for Ciscoe, as planting, weeding and watering must fit between TV, radio, and personal appearance commitments. Both Ciscoe and Mary’s touches bring forth the very best each plant has to offer, despite the couples’ sweet-natured competition for space in their standing-room-only garden. Don’t miss this chance to admire their plants or to ask questions—you may even elicit an “ooh la la” or two.</p>

	 				<p>Jason Jorgensen, NHS board member and owner of Third Spring Landscape Design, has transformed a tired old front lawn into a densely planted summer dry garden featuring a selection of drought-tolerant yet winter-hardy trees, shrubs, perennials, and billowing grasses. Sharing the spotlight is a massive Magnolia grandiflora whose canopy allows a woodland-inspired understory to flourish. Fire-burnished juniper & black granite sett steps lead the way into the back where an in-ground water feature made from a granite slab is centered among a richly planted mixed border featuring a tapestry of perennials, roses, and evergreens. Here you’ll find a host of pollinators such as a resident flock of humming birds, butterflies, and a grist of non-stinging mason bees. This prominent Bryant corner lot has become a new focal point for the whole neighborhood.</p>
